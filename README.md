# Cubic Iterator Attractor Renderer

A high-performance Python/Cython pipeline for generating and visualizing high-dimensional **iterated map attractors**.  
This project explores chaotic structures defined by discrete cubic maps in 2–8 dimensions, using optimized numerical kernels and a custom renderer.

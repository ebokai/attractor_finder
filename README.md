# Cubic Iterator Attractor Renderer

A high-performance Python/Cython pipeline for generating and visualizing high-dimensional **iterated map attractors**.  
This project explores chaotic structures defined by discrete cubic maps in 2‚Äì8 dimensions, using optimized numerical kernels and a custom renderer.

## üîß Features

- Random coefficient search for bounded orbits (`search.py`)
- Iterative evaluation of cubic polynomial maps in arbitrary dimension (`iterator_cubic.pyx`)
- Attractor rendering using Cython pixel compositing (`renderer.pyx`)
- Color normalization and adjustable alpha blending (`render.py`)
- Automated build and run scripts (`setup.bat`, `run.bat`)
- Configurable paper sizes and output resolutions (`print_sizes.py`)

## üß† Core Concept

Each attractor is generated by repeatedly applying a discrete cubic map  
\[
x_{n+1} = f(x_n; a_i)
\]
where the coefficients \(a_i\) are drawn randomly.  
The iteration is performed in Cython for performance, producing millions of points per second.  
The renderer projects the trajectory onto a 2D plane, accumulating density with soft compositing to emphasize filamentary geometry.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **main.py** | Entry point ‚Äî coordinates search, iteration, and rendering of attractors. |
| **search.py** | Randomly samples coefficient sets until a visually dense attractor is found. |
| **compute.py** | Handles iteration and error checking before rendering. |
| **render.py** | Python-level orchestration for color interpolation, normalization, and file saving. |
| **renderer.pyx** | Cython implementation of pixel compositing (optimized per-sample loop). |
| **iterator_cubic.pyx** | Cython kernel implementing the cubic iteration map in N dimensions. |
| **functions.py** | Helper routines for coordinate scaling, aspect ratio correction, etc. |
| **print_sizes.py** | Stores print resolutions for different paper sizes (e.g., `{'A4': (1920,1080)}`). |
| **setup_renderer.py** / **setup_iterator.py** | Individual build scripts for each Cython extension. |
| **setup.bat** | Windows batch file to compile both extensions using MinGW (`build_ext --inplace`). |
| **run.bat** | Runs `main.py` and keeps the terminal open on completion. |
| **render/** | Output folder for generated images (ignored by Git). |
| **build/**, **dist/** | Auto-created by the Cython build process (ignored by Git). |
